### What is container?
>A **container** is a lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run an application:
    - Code
    - Runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js)
    - Libraries
    - Environment variables
    - Configuration files

Containers are **isolated** from each other and from the host system, ensuring consistency across different environments (e.g., your laptop, a server, or the cloud).

#### Summary
Docker is a tool for **packaging, distributing, and running applications** in isolated environments called **containers**.
